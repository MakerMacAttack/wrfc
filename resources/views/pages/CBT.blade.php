        <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>The Cherry Blossom Tournament is one of the largest rugby tournaments in the United States. The tournament has routinely had 40+ teams participate, and Washington RFC is proud to welcome some of the best high school and college teams in the country. The tournament also has a tradition of attracting teams from Canada, and has also had other international participants, including an all-Japanese High School team and a touring side from Australia. In 2018, the Men's 7s College division was re-introduced. We are still committed to giving those that prefer 15s an opportunity to compete in the Spring, but we also want to provide opportunities for clubs that have moved to full-time 7s.</p>
